Sprint Review:

1st Sprint:
In the first sprint, we have showed our UML diagram to the SL and each of us has picked a topic. We have topics about moba game, NBA, music player and makeups. The SL thought we were kind of ahead. 

2nd Sprint:
In the second sprint, we have implemented one bot that can respond some default commands in a chatroom. Michael told us to implement all four bots for the next sprints.

3rd Sprint:
We were a little bit delayed since we did not have four fully implemented bots. However, we have done with the signIn and signUp.
